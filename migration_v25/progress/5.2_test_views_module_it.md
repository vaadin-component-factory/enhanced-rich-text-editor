# Phase 5.2: Test Views → Module IT

**Status:** NOT STARTED

---

## Goal

Move test views and Playwright tests from the demo module into the module's own test infrastructure. This improves separation of concerns: the demo module should only contain user-facing demo views, not test infrastructure.

## Scope

- Move `ErteTabStopTestView`, `ErtePlaceholderTestView`, `ErteReadonlyTestView`, `ErteToolbarTestView`, `ErteExtendOptionsTestView`, `ErteFeatureTestView` out of the demo
- Move corresponding Playwright test specs (`tests/erte/`) into module integration tests
- Set up Playwright test infrastructure in the ERTE module(s)
- Update `ErteTestLayout` and test routing accordingly
- Ensure all tests still pass after the move

## Out of Scope

- Writing new tests
- Changing test behavior

## Dependencies

- All Phase 3 and Phase 4 tests must be green before restructuring
