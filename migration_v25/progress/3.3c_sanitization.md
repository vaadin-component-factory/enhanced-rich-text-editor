# Phase 3.3c: Security Hardening — HTML Sanitization (Feature 11)

## Status: NOT STARTED

## Feature Summary
Security hardening of the sanitizer override established in Phase 3b. The basic sanitizer
(ERTE class whitelist) is built incrementally across feature phases. This phase adds
**restrictive** security fixes that don't affect feature functionality.

**Note:** The sanitizer class whitelist (`ql-readonly`, `ql-tab`, `ql-soft-break`,
`ql-placeholder`, `contenteditable="false"`) is added incrementally in phases 3.1b/3.1c/3.1e/3.1f.
This phase only handles the security hardening below.

## Dependencies
- Phase 3.1b (Readonly) — sanitizer override structure established there
- Ideally after all blot features (3.1b, 3.1c, 3.1e, 3.1f) to verify nothing breaks

## Security Fixes Required
- Restrict `style` attribute to allowed CSS properties (ERTE 1 allows unrestricted `style`)
- Restrict `data:` protocol to `data:image/*` only (ERTE 1 allows any `data:` URL)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `style` attribute restricted to safe CSS properties
- [ ] `data:` protocol restricted to `data:image/*`
- [ ] Existing features still work after hardening
- [ ] Unit tests for sanitizer edge cases
