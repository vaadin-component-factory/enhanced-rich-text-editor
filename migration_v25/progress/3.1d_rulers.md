# Phase 3.1d: Rulers (Feature 2)

## Status: NOT STARTED

## Feature Summary
Horizontal/vertical rulers as base64 PNG backgrounds. Click-to-add tabstop with alignment cycling.
`noRulers` property toggles visibility.

## Dependencies
- Phase 3.1c (Tabstops) — ruler interacts with tabstop array

## Key References
- USE_CASE_ANALYSIS.md Feature 2
- Spike Item 4 (toolbar/render override works)
- V24 source: `_addTabStop(event)`, `_rulerDisplay()`, ruler CSS

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Ruler DOM injected via `render()` override
- [ ] Click handler creates/cycles/removes tabstops (LEFT → RIGHT → MIDDLE → remove)
- [ ] `noRulers` Java property toggles visibility
- [ ] Ruler markers reflect current tabstop positions
- [ ] Playwright tests
