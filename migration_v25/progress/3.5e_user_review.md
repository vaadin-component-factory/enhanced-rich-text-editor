# GENERAL
* dont use our scripts in documentation, the user will use plain mvn oder mvnw
* dont use migration package names. the v25 suffix is just for migration, it will be removed after the migrtion is done
* and with this also the v24 sources will be removed after the migration is done, so do not name them 
* the target versions will be 6.0.0 (erte) and 2.0.0 (table extension), dont use snapshots
* the version history names the current v24 as the master branch. that is currently correct, but the readme is for "later", when the V25 version has been released. 
* the RTE was already a commercial component in V24
* Only the ERTE 6.0 will use Lumo, therefore referencing it in this case as 6.x is wrong
* dont use EAGER value change mode, as this is a very untypical scenario for a large text editor component - ON_CHANGE is the most common one here
* the docs are written for humans primarily

# USER GUIDE
## 1.4
* the binder sample makes no sense. it does not show how to bind the field with binder. the value change validate can be removed

## 2.1
* context menu on left-click (not right-click) - remove that (not right click) - the users are not stupid
* ToolbarDialog: use the constructor in the code sample instead of vertical

* API Sidenote: ToolbarButtonVisibility api am ERTE is irgendwie crude. Da fehlt ein setToolbarButtonsVisibility(boolean, ToolbarButton buttons...) ein ein clearToolbarButtonsVisibility()

* (UNDO, REDO, BOLD, ITALIC, UNDERLINE, STRIKE, COLOR, BACKGROUND, H1, H2, H3, SUBSCRIPT, SUPERSCRIPT, LIST_ORDERED, LIST_BULLET, OUTDENT, INDENT, ALIGN_LEFT, ALIGN_CENTER, ALIGN_RIGHT, IMAGE, LINK, BLOCKQUOTE, CODE_BLOCK, CLEAN) and 5 ERTE-specific buttons (READONLY, PLACEHOLDER, PLACEHOLDER_APPEARANCE, WHITESPACE, ALIGN_JUSTIFY). -> reomve, no human reads that

* API Sidenote: editor.addStandardToolbarButtonShortcut(
  EnhancedRichTextEditor.ToolbarButton.BOLD,
  "b", true, true, false);  // shortKey=Ctrl, shiftKey=true, altKey=false -> this is also awkward api, would be good to have a simple MetaKey and use that as a varargs here

*  new Icon(VaadinIcon.STAR)) -> VaadinIcon.STAR.create() is the correct approach, no one does new Icon
