# Phase 5.1: V24 Sample Views Migration

**Status:** NOT STARTED

---

## Goal

Migrate the V24 demo/sample views to V25 demo application. The V24 demo views showcase ERTE features and serve as usage examples for developers.

## Scope

- Review existing V24 demo views in `enhanced-rich-text-editor-demo/` (V24 code)
- Create equivalent V25 demo views using the new ERTE 2 API
- Ensure all major features are demonstrated (tabstops, placeholders, readonly, tables, etc.)
- Update navigation/routing to include new demo views

## Out of Scope

- Test views (covered by Phase 5.2)
- New demo features not present in V24

## Dependencies

- Phase 4 (Tables) should be complete
- Phase 5.0 (API Audit) should be complete to ensure the demo uses the finalized API
