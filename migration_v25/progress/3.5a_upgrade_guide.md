# Phase 3.5a: Upgrade Guide ERTE 1→2

**Status:** PARTIAL

**Review Required:** This documentation was created before phases 3.4f-j were identified. After implementing 3.4f-j (slotted toolbar styles, toolbar helper classes, Aura theme support), this guide must be reviewed and updated to reflect:
- New toolbar customization APIs (ToolbarPopover, ToolbarSelectPopup, ToolbarDialog)
- Aura theme migration notes (in addition to Lumo)
- Slotted button styling considerations

See `/workspace/migration_v25/progress/3.5_docs_review_after_3.4fj.md` for detailed gap analysis.

## Objective

Create a comprehensive upgrade guide for users migrating from ERTE 1 (Vaadin 24 / Quill 1) to ERTE 2 (Vaadin 25 / Quill 2).

## Scope

### Document Contents

1. **Prerequisites & Dependencies**
   - Vaadin 24→25 upgrade requirements
   - Java version requirements (Java 21+)
   - Maven coordinate changes (ERTE 5.x → 6.x)
   - Spring Boot 3→4 considerations

2. **Breaking Changes**
   - Primary value format (Delta → HTML)
   - `asDelta()` wrapper API
   - Deprecated methods (extendQuill/extendEditor)
   - Removed features (if any)
   - API signature changes

3. **Feature Migration Guide**
   - Feature-by-feature code examples (V24 → V25)
   - Configuration changes
   - Event handling differences
   - Styling/theming updates

4. **Known Limitations**
   - Quill 2 embed guard node effects
   - History/undo behavior changes
   - Copy-paste limitations
   - Browser compatibility notes

5. **Migration Strategy**
   - Step-by-step migration process
   - Testing recommendations
   - Rollback considerations
   - Gradual vs. big-bang approach

6. **Troubleshooting**
   - Common migration issues
   - Debugging tips
   - Where to get help

## Success Criteria

- [x] All breaking changes documented with code examples (13 breaking changes in Section 3)
- [x] Each of 20 features has migration guidance (Section 4, organized by effort tier)
- [x] Clear step-by-step migration path (Section 6, big-bang and gradual approaches)
- [x] Known issues and workarounds listed (Section 5 + Section 7 troubleshooting)
- [x] Migration checklist (Section 8, 4 phases with checkboxes)
- [ ] Reviewed by docs-engineer agent (optional follow-up)
