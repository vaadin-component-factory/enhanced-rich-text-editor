# Phase 5.3: Ultimate Documentation Review — Ship-Ready

**Status:** NOT STARTED

---

## Goal

**Final, comprehensive documentation review before release.** Three pillars:

1. **User review fixes** — Apply all feedback from `3.5e_user_review.md` (global rules + USER_GUIDE specifics)
2. **Humanization** — Rewrite machine-generated prose for human readers (tone, brevity, practical focus)
3. **Multi-agent deep review** — Every relevant agent reviews every doc for their domain:
   - **docs-engineer** — Structure, completeness, cross-references, audience fit
   - **code-reviewer** — Code examples correct? Match actual API? Compile?
   - **security-reviewer** — Sanitizer docs accurate? No misleading security advice?
   - **architecture-guard** — Architecture docs match actual codebase? No stale patterns?
   - **requirements-reviewer** — Do docs cover all 20 ERTE features? Gaps?
   - **ui-designer** — CSS/theming docs accurate? Custom properties match implementation?

After this phase, docs are **ship-ready** — no further review needed before release.

## Prior Work (already done)

- **Phase 5.c:** Dev docs dramatically shortened — non-ERTE content removed, module paths fixed, test architecture moved to CONTRIBUTING.md. DEVELOPER_GUIDE 467→214 lines, EXTENDING 572→431.
- **CONFIGURATION.md merged into API_REFERENCE.md** — redundant file deleted, unique content (shadow parts, CSS classes, 20 custom properties, sanitizer whitelist, value format guide) moved to API_REFERENCE sections 13-18.
- **Docs reorganized** into `docs/user/` and `docs/dev/` subdirectories.

## Scope

Files to review and humanize (all in `docs/`):

### User docs (`docs/user/`)
- **USER_GUIDE.md** (~940 lines) — Focus on practical usage, reduce verbose explanations
- **API_REFERENCE.md** (~1490 lines) — Verify accuracy, improve readability of new sections 13-18
- **UPGRADE_GUIDE.md** (~1800 lines) — Reduce verbosity, improve clarity of migration steps

### Dev docs (`docs/dev/`)
- **DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** (~214 lines) — Already compact, light review only
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** (~469 lines) — Check absorbed test architecture reads well
- **EXTENDING.md** (~431 lines) — Already trimmed, light review only
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** (~342 lines) — Light review only

### Project root
- **README.md** — Completeness and tone
- **enhanced-rich-text-editor/README.md** — Completeness and tone
- **enhanced-rich-text-editor-tables/README.md** — Completeness and tone

## Execution Plan

### Round 1: Apply user review fixes + humanize
1. Apply all 8 global rules across ALL docs (SNAPSHOTs, scripts, versions, etc.)
2. Apply USER_GUIDE-specific fixes (sections 1.4, 2.1)
3. Humanize prose: shorten verbose sections, remove machine-generated tone, make practical

### Round 2: Multi-agent deep review (parallel)
Launch ALL agents simultaneously, each reviewing ALL user-facing docs:

| Agent | Focus | Files |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **docs-engineer** | Structure, flow, audience, cross-refs, completeness | All docs |
| **code-reviewer** | Code examples compile, match API, use correct patterns | USER_GUIDE, API_REFERENCE, UPGRADE_GUIDE |
| **security-reviewer** | Sanitizer docs, XSS guidance, security best practices | USER_GUIDE 3.4, API_REFERENCE 16, SECURITY.md |
| **architecture-guard** | Architecture docs match codebase, no stale patterns | ARCHITECTURE, EXTENDING, DEVELOPER_GUIDE |
| **requirements-reviewer** | All 20 features documented? Feature coverage gaps? | USER_GUIDE, API_REFERENCE |
| **ui-designer** | CSS properties, theming, styling docs match implementation | API_REFERENCE 13-15, USER_GUIDE 2.10 |

### Round 3: Fix findings + final verification
1. Consolidate all agent findings
2. Apply fixes
3. Quick re-review of changed sections

## Out of Scope

- Javadoc changes (covered by code quality reviews)
- Migration progress files (internal, not shipped)
- Tables docs (`enhanced-rich-text-editor-tables/docs/`) — separate review if needed

## User Review Findings (from `3.5e_user_review.md`)

Feedback from initial user review. Apply these across ALL docs:

### Global rules
1. **No internal scripts** — use plain `mvn` or `mvnw`, not `v25-build.sh` etc.
2. **No migration package names** — the `-v25` suffix is temporary, will be removed after migration. Don't name V24 sources either (they'll be deleted).
3. **Target versions** — `6.0.0` (ERTE) and `2.0.0` (Tables), no SNAPSHOTs
4. **Version history** — don't reference `master` as V24 branch; docs are for post-release
5. **RTE was already commercial in V24** — don't imply it became commercial in V25
6. **Lumo only for 6.0** — don't write "6.x" when referencing Lumo-only, it's specifically 6.0
7. **No EAGER value change mode** — use `ON_CHANGE` in examples (EAGER is atypical for large text editors)
8. **Docs are for humans** — remove machine-generated lists nobody reads

### USER_GUIDE specific
- **1.4:** Binder sample is wrong — doesn't show actual binding, remove the value-change validate
- **2.1:** Remove "(not right-click)" — users aren't stupid
- **2.1:** ToolbarDialog: use constructor in code sample, not `vertical()` factory
- **2.1:** Remove the long inline list of all 30 button enum values — no human reads that
- **2.1:** `new Icon(VaadinIcon.STAR)` → `VaadinIcon.STAR.create()` everywhere

### API Sidenotes (not doc changes, but API improvements to consider)
- `setToolbarButtonsVisibility` API is crude — would benefit from `setToolbarButtonsVisibility(boolean, ToolbarButton...)` + `clearToolbarButtonsVisibility()`
- `addStandardToolbarButtonShortcut` with 3 booleans is awkward — would benefit from a `MetaKey` varargs approach

## Dependencies

- Phase 5.0 (API Audit) — COMPLETE
- Phase 5.1 (Demo Migration) — COMPLETE
- Phase 5.c (Dev docs shortening) — COMPLETE
