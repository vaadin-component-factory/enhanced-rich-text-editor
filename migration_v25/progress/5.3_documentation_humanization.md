# Phase 5.3: Documentation Humanization Review

**Status:** NOT STARTED

---

## Goal

Rewrite documentation for human readers. Current documentation was largely generated during migration and has a machine-generated tone. This phase improves readability, removes redundancy, and ensures docs serve their target audience.

## Scope

- Review and rewrite UPGRADE_GUIDE.md for clarity and conciseness
- Review and rewrite USER_DOCUMENTATION.md — focus on practical usage
- Review and rewrite DEVELOPER_DOCUMENTATION.md — dramatically reduce size, keep only ERTE-specific content (remove Quill 2 and RTE 2 content that belongs in their own docs)
- Review README.md for completeness and tone
- Remove or archive migration-internal documentation that's no longer relevant post-release

## Out of Scope

- Javadoc changes (those are covered by code quality reviews)
- Migration progress files (internal, not shipped)

## Dependencies

- Phase 5.0 (API Audit) should be complete to ensure documented APIs are final
- Phase 5.1 (Demo Migration) should be complete to ensure code examples are correct
