# Phase 3.4: Open issues

## Status: NOT STARTED

## Description
This special phase will be worked on as last part of phase 3. It contains minor issues or open points, that have been
discovered during the different implementation phases, which were not important enough to block the ongoing migration.

They shall be worked on step by step.

## Open Issues

### Placeholders button not shown as "active", when cursor beside a placeholder

Normally the placeholder button should be marked as "active", when the textcursor is placed beside a placeholder in the editor (via mouse or keyboard).
Currently this is not the case, the button stays "inactive".

It might be, that the guard elements of Quill 2 interfere here with the recognition of standing "beside" a placeholder. The event log shows
"PlaceholderLeave" immediately, even when the cursor is still at the placeholder.

### Toolbar arrow-key navigation broken (Left/Right)

When a toolbar button has focus, Left/Right arrow keys do nothing (console error likely). Tab → editor works, Shift+Tab → previous button works. But Left/Right should cycle through buttons — this works in stock RTE 2, so ERTE must be breaking it somehow. Likely the keyboard shortcut injection or slot injection interferes with the parent's `__patchToolbar()` keyboard handling.
