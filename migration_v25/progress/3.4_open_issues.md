# Phase 3.4: Open Issues — Tier 4

## Status: NOT STARTED

## Description

**Tier 4** collects minor issues and open points discovered during feature implementation phases (3.1–3.3) that were not critical enough to block migration progress. These are typically polish issues, edge cases, or cross-cutting improvements that become apparent once the main features are in place.

This tier is worked on **last** in Phase 3, after all core features (Tiers 1–3) are complete. Each issue gets its own lettered subphase (3.4a, 3.4b, etc.) for independent implementation and testing.

## Subphases

- **3.4a**: Placeholder button active state fix
- **3.4b**: Toolbar arrow-key navigation (Left/Right)
- **3.4c**: Whitespace indicators for spaces and NBSP
